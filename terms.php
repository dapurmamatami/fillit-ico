										SCOPE OF THIS AGREEMENT
										 <ol>
										 	<li>
										 		Your Card is an e-money prepaid card regulated by the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission. The Card does not constitute a checking, savings or other bank account and is not connected in any way to any other account you may have. This is not a credit, charge, or Prepaid Card. 
											</li>
											<li>
												Your Card has been issued by us in accordance with a license from the Association or its affiliates. Your Card is our property and is not transferable to anyone else. Your rights and obligations relating to the use of this Card are subject to this Agreement between you and us; you have no rights against the Association or its affiliates. If you experience any difficulties in using the Card you should contact the Card Support team. The e-money associated with this Card is provided to you by us, and will be denominated in the base currency which you choose (see paragraph 11). The Card remains our property and must be destroyed or returned upon request. 
											</li>
											<li>
												These terms and conditions are written and available only in English and we undertake to communicate with you in English regarding any aspect of your Card. 
											</li>
										</ol>
									</li>
									<li>
										PURCHASE, RECEIPT AND ACTIVATION OF CARDS
										<ol>
											<li>
												You may only apply for one Card at any one time and the Card cannot be used on a corporation's behalf. The Card is not transferrable and shall only be used by you strictly in accordance with this Agreement.
											</li>
											<li>
												We will issue your Card to you on the basis of the information provided in your Application. You agree to provide accurate personal information and to tell us of any changes as soon as possible so that our records remain correct. You should update any changes to your personal information via the profile link at the Website. If you wish to load your Card with more than 2500 EUR (or foreign currency equivalent), we require you to provide us with additional personal information to meet regulatory "know your customer" ("KYC") requirements. Your Card limits are governed by your KYC level (see paragraph 11). You may increase your limits and Card functionality at any time by providing us your KYC documentation. You can email a copy of your unexpired government-issued identification and a recent utility bill bearing the same address as your registered address with us to support@FILLIT.eu. Once these documents are received and verified we will upgrade your KYC level. Additional verification data may be required.
											</li>
											<li>
												If we are unable to satisfactorily verify your identity from information provided in your Application, we will not be able to process your Application until further information is collected and verified.
											</li>
											<li>
												Your Card will be posted to the address you designate, or designated on your behalf, in your Application. You should ordinarily receive your Card within approximately 5-10 business days of Application.
											</li>
											<li>
												When you receive your Card, you must sign it immediately.
											</li>
											<li>
												 You may use your Card to make cash withdrawals. You will need a PIN for ATM withdrawals and to authorise any CHIP-based retail sales Transactions.
											</li>
											<li>
												When you call the IVR to activate your Card by providing your Card Number, CVV number and date of birth, we will activate your Card and provide you with a PIN for use with your Card. You should never reveal your PIN to anybody. We will not reveal your PIN to a third party. If you forget your PIN you can reset it by contacting the Card Support team. Please note we will need to verify your identity to make this change. For security purposes, you must keep your PIN secure and separate from your Card or any record of your Card number. Failure to do so will be treated as gross negligence and will affect your ability to claim any losses and may render you liable for applicable losses to your Account.
											</li>
											<li>
												You can change your PIN at ATM cash machines displaying the Visa® acceptance mark. When you change your PIN, you must not select a PIN that may be easily guessed, such as a number that (a) is easily associated with you, such as your telephone number or birth date; (b) is part of data imprinted on the Card; (c) consists of the same digits or a sequence of running digits; or (d) is identical to the previously selected PIN.
											</li>
										</ol>
									</li>
									<li>
										USE OF CARDS
										<ol>
											<li>
												Your Card can be used at any Merchant who accepts Visa (fees & limits apply, see paragraph 11), but no guarantee is provided that every Merchant will accept your Card for a given Transaction.
											</li>
											<li>
												Cards can be used to make cash withdrawals at ATMs bearing the Visa® acceptance marks or at participating banks to make cash advance withdrawals (fees apply, see paragraph 11) up to the amount specified for your particular card (see paragraph 11 and the Fees and Limits Schedule). Please note some Merchants or ATMs may have lower limits than those permitted under this Agreement. Please note that extra ATM fees in addition to those shown at paragraph 11 may be charged by certain ATM providers. 
											</li>
											<li>
												Your Card is a prepaid card, which means that the Card's Available Balance will be reduced by the full amount of each Transaction and authorisation, plus any taxes and charges that are applicable including any additional ATM charge if any (the 'Full Deductible Amount'). The Full Deductible Amount must be less than or equal to the Available Balance on your Card. You must not use your Card if the Full Deductible Amount exceeds the Available Balance or after the expiry date of the Card. If, for any reason, a Transaction is processed for an amount greater than the Available Balance on your Card, you must repay us the amount by which the Full Deductible Amount exceeds your Available Balance within 14 days of receiving an invoice from us. Should you not repay this amount within 14 days of receiving an invoice from us we reserve the right to take all steps necessary, including legal action, to recover any monies outstanding. 
											</li>
											<li>
												You can check your Available Balance by contacting the Card Support team, logging into the Website, or calling the IVR; fees may apply.
											</li>
											<li>
												Due to security safeguards, Merchants that accept your Card are required to seek authorisation from us for all Transactions. There are some circumstances where Merchants may require you to have an Available Balance greater than the value of the Transaction you wish to make; however, you will only be charged for the actual and final value of the Transaction you make. Merchants request this as they may need to access more funds than you initially planned to spend. For example:
												<ol>
													<li>
														Hotels and rental cars - As Merchants may not be able to accurately predict how much your final bill will be, they may request an authorisation for funds greater than your Available Balance. 
													</li>
													<li>
														Restaurants - You will need to have an Available Balance equivalent to the total cost of the meal plus up to 20%. This is to accommodate any service charge that could be added to your bill. 
													</li>
													<li>
														Internet Merchants - Certain Internet Merchant sites will, on registration or at checkout stage, send a request for payment authorisation to verify that funds are available; this will temporarily impact your Available Balance. Also please bear in mind that many sites won't deduct payment until goods are dispatched so please be aware of these variances on cleared funds when checking your balance and ensure that funds are always available to cover your purchases.
													</li>
													<li>
														In-flight purchases - Merchants may not be able to authorise your Transaction if they cannot obtain an online authorisation from us. Examples include on-board cruise or train charges and some in-flight purchases.
													</li>
													<li>
														Membership or subscriptions - Please ensure that you always have sufficient Available Balance on your Card if you use it to make recurring charges, such as memberships or subscriptions. 
													</li>
													<li>
														 Self-service petrol pumps - Your Card cannot be used at self-service petrol pumps. You can use your Card to pay by taking it to the cashier.
													</li>
													<li>
														The Available Balance on your Account will not earn any interest.
													</li>
													<li>
														 We may request you to surrender the Card at any time for a valid reason in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 15 of this Agreement. Where we do so, we will give you back your e-money in accordance with paragraph 7 of this Agreement (free of redemption fee charge).
													</li>
													<li>
														If you are entitled to a refund for any reason for goods or services obtained with your Card, you agree to accept credits to your Card for such refunds. The amounts credited to your Card for refunds may not be available for up to five (5) days from the date the refund transaction occurs.
													</li>
													<li>
														Restrictions and Prohibited Transactions. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to add categories of prohibited transactions by adding such categories either to this Agreement or an acceptable use policy published on the Website.
														<ol>
															<li>
																It is strictly forbidden to use your Card for any illegal purposes including but not limited to fraud and money laundering. We will report any suspicious activity to the relevant law enforcement agency. You are prohibited from using your Card in an attempt to abuse, exploit or circumvent the usage restrictions imposed by a Merchant on the services it provides.
															</li>
														</ol>
													</li>
												</ol>
											</li>

											</li>
										</ol>
									</li>
									<li>
										ACCOUNTHOLDER LIABILITY AND AUTHORISATIONS
										<ol>
											<li>

										LOST, STOLEN OR DAMAGED CARDS
										<ol>
											<li>
												You should treat the e-money on your Card like cash in a wallet. If you lose your Card or it is stolen you may lose any e-money on it in just the same way as if you lost your wallet.
											</li>
											<li>
												In the event of loss, theft, fraud or any other risk of an unauthorised use of your Card, or if your Card is damaged or malfunctions, you must immediately call the IVR number and select the appropriate IVR option and follow the instructions or you can contact the Card Support team. You will be asked to provide us with your Card Number and some identifying details. You will be liable for any unauthorised Transactions that take place prior to you notifying us and these will reduce your Available Balance. If there is an Available Balance remaining on your Card, we will replace your Card and transfer the last Available Balance on to it, unless we have any reason to believe that the notified incident has been caused by your breach of this Agreement, gross negligence or if it raises reasonable suspicion of fraudulent or improper conduct. If we replace the Card, the replacement Card will be sent to your address on record. (fees may apply, see paragraph 11). 
											</li>
											<li>

										TRANSACTIONS MADE IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES
										<ol>
											<li>
												If you make a Transaction in a currency other than the base currency you selected in your Application (a 'Foreign Currency Transaction'), the amount deducted from your Account will be converted to such base currency on the day we receive details of that Foreign Currency Transaction. We will use a rate set by the Association. This rate will include a Foreign Exchange Fee (see paragraph 11). Exchange rates can fluctuate and they may change between the time a Transaction is made and the time it is deducted from your Available Balance.
											</li>
										</ol>
									</li>
									<li>

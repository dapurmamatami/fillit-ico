This is not a credit, charge, or debit card. 2.2 Your Card has been issued by us in accordance with a license from the Association or its affiliates. Your Card is our property and is not transferable to anyone else. Your rights and obligations relating to the use of this Card are subject to this Agreement between you and us; you have no rights against the Association or its affiliates. If you experience any difficulties in using the Card you should contact the Card Support team. The e-money associated with this Card is provided to you by us, and will be denominated in the base currency which you choose (see paragraph 11). The Card remains our property and must be destroyed or returned upon request. 2.3 These terms and conditions are written and available only in English and we undertake to communicate with you in English regarding any aspect of your Card. 3. PURCHASE, RECEIPT AND ACTIVATION OF CARDS 3.1 You may only apply for one Card at any one time and the Card cannot be used on a corporation's behalf. The Card is not transferrable and shall only be used by you strictly in accordance with this Agreement. 3.2 We will issue your Card to you on the basis of the information provided in your Application. You agree to provide accurate personal information and to tell us of any changes as soon as possible so that our records remain correct. You should update any changes to your personal information via the profile link at the Website. If you wish to load your Card with more than 2500 EUR (or foreign currency equivalent), we require you to provide us with additional personal information to meet regulatory "know your customer" ("KYC") requirements. Your Card limits are governed by your KYC level (see paragraph 11). You may increase your limits and Card functionality at any time by providing us your KYC documentation. You can email a copy of your unexpired government-issued identification and a recent utility bill bearing the same address as your registered address with us to support@fillit.eu. Once these documents are received and verified we will upgrade your KYC level. Additional verification data may be required. 3.3 If we are unable to satisfactorily verify your identity from information provided in your Application, we will not be able to process your Application until further information is collected and verified. 3.4 Your Card will be posted to the address you designate, or designated on your behalf, in your Application.

date; (b) is part of data imprinted on the Card; (c) consists of the same digits or a sequence of running digits; or (d) is identical to the previously selected PIN. 4. USE OF CARDS 4.1 Your Card can be used at any Merchant who accepts Mastercard (fees &amp; limits apply, see paragraph 11), but no guarantee is provided that every Merchant will accept your Card for a given Transaction. 4.2 Cards can be used to make cash withdrawals at ATMs bearing the Mastercard® acceptance marks or at participating banks to make cash advance withdrawals (fees apply, see paragraph 11) up to the amount specified for your particular card (see paragraph 11 and the Fees and Limits Schedule). Please note some Merchants or ATMs may have lower limits than those permitted under this Agreement. Please note that extra ATM fees in addition to those shown at paragraph 11 may be charged by certain ATM providers. 4.3 Your Card is a prepaid card, which means that the Card's Available Balance will be reduced by the full amount of each Transaction and authorisation, plus any taxes and charges that are applicable including any additional ATM charge if any (the 'Full Deductible Amount'). The Full Deductible Amount must be less than or equal to the Available Balance on your Card. You must not use your Card if the Full Deductible Amount exceeds the Available Balance or after the expiry date of the Card. If, for any reason, a Transaction is processed for an amount greater than the Available Balance on your Card, you must repay us the amount by which the Full Deductible Amount exceeds your Available Balance within 14 days of receiving an invoice from us. Should you not repay this amount within 14 days of receiving an invoice from us we reserve the right to take all steps necessary, including legal action, to recover any monies outstanding. 4.4 You can check your Available Balance by contacting the Card Support team, logging into the Website, or calling the IVR; fees may apply. 4.5 Due to security safeguards, Merchants that accept your Card are required to seek authorisation from us for all Transactions. There are some circumstances where Merchants may require you to have an Available Balance greater than the value of the Transaction you wish to make; however, you will only be charged for the actual and final value of the Transaction you make. Merchants request this as they may need to access more funds than you initially planned to spend. For example: 4.5.1 Hotels and rental cars - As Merchants may not be able to accurately predict how much your final bill will be, they may request an authorisation for funds greater than your Available Balance. 4.5.2 Restaurants - You will need to have an Available Balance equivalent to the total cost of the meal plus up to 20%. This is to accommodate any service charge that could be added to your bill. 4.5.3 Internet Merchants - Certain Internet Merchant sites will, on registration or at checkout stage, send a request for payment authorisation to verify that funds are available; this will temporarily impact your Available Balance. Also please bear in mind that many sites won't deduct payment until goods are dispatched so please be aware of these variances on cleared funds when checking your balance and ensure that funds are always available to cover your purchases.<br>

<span style="color:red">https:_____________________________________</span><br>
4.5.4 In-flight purchases - Merchants may not be able to authorise your Transaction if they cannot obtain an online authorisation from us. Examples include on-board cruise or train charges and some in-flight purchases. 4.5.5 Membership or subscriptions - Please ensure that you always have sufficient Available Balance on your Card if you use it to make recurring charges, such as memberships or subscriptions. 4.6 Self-service petrol pumps - Your Card cannot be used at self-service petrol pumps. You can use your Card to pay by taking it to the cashier. 4.7 The Available Balance on your Account will not earn any interest. 4.8 We may request you to surrender the Card at any time for a valid reason in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 15 of this Agreement. Where we do so, we will give you back your e-money in accordance with paragraph 7 of this Agreement (free of redemption fee charge). 4.9 If you are entitled to a refund for any reason for goods or services obtained with your Card, you agree to accept credits to your Card for such refunds. The amounts credited to your Card for refunds may not be available for up to five (5) days from the date the refund transaction occurs. 4.10 Restrictions and Prohibited Transactions. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to add categories of prohibited transactions by adding such categories either to this Agreement or an acceptable use policy published on the Website. 4.10.1 It is strictly forbidden to use your Card for any illegal purposes including but not limited to fraud and money laundering. We will report any suspicious activity to the relevant law enforcement agency. You are prohibited from using your Card in an attempt to abuse, exploit or circumvent the usage restrictions imposed by a Merchant on the services it provides. 5. LOADING FUNDS TO YOUR ACCOUNT 5.1 Your Card is a payout card tied to an account directly or indirectly established by an employer or other such corporate payor (each, a "Payor") on behalf of a consumer to which electronic funds transfers of the consumer's wages or other compensation are made on a recurring basis, whether the account is operated or managed by the employer, a third party payout processor, or a depository institution. Only funds from a Payor may be loaded to your Account In case of errors or questions about the funds loaded to your Account, contact your payout provider. 5.2 Deposits to your Account from your Payor will be made available on the payout file clearing date. You authorize your Payor and us to recover any funds erroneously added to your Account. If an authorized addition to your Account has an error or if you require additional information regarding funds added or loaded, you must contact your Payor immediately. You should keep track of the amount of funds loaded to your Account. You are responsible for reporting to all applicable government tax authorities, all earnings received and loaded to your Account and the payment of any applicable local, national, or international taxes that apply to such earnings. 5.3 We reserve the right to suspend or terminate the right to load funds to your Card at any time without notice. 6. CARD EXPIRY 6.1 The expiry date of your Card is printed on the front of the Card. You will not be able to use your Card if it has expired. Unless otherwise advised a renewal Card will be sent to you before your existing Card expires. 6.2 We may decide not to renew your Card. If we decide to do this we will provide you with 30 days notice prior to the expiry of the Card. 6.3 No Transaction will be processed once your Card has expired.<br>

<span style="color:red">https:_____________________________________</span><br>
 7. REDEEMING E-MONEY 7.1 If you would like to terminate your Card and redeem any unused funds, you may do so as long as: (a) the Available Balance is greater than €10.00 or currency equivalent; (b) we believe you have not acted fraudulently; and (c) we are not prohibited from doing so by any applicable law, regulation, court order or instruction or guidance of a competent regulatory authority or agency. 7.2 You can obtain redemption of any unused funds by contacting the Card Support team. 7.2.1 We will charge a redemption fee as detailed in the Fees and Limits Schedule. 7.3 Please note that our procedures may require us to carry out various identity checks reasonably required to prevent fraudulent use of your Card before we can process your redemption request. 8. ACCOUNTHOLDER LIABILITY AND AUTHORISATIONS 8.1 We may restrict or refuse to authorise any use of your Card if using the Card is causing or could cause a breach of this Agreement or if we have reasonable grounds for suspecting that either you or a third party has committed or is about to commit a crime or other abuse in connection with the Card. 8.2 If we need to investigate a Transaction on the Card then you must cooperate with us, or any other authorised body if this is required. 8.3 You should never: (a) allow another person to use your Card; (b) record your PIN or Password in writing, or with your Card or otherwise; (c) disclose your PIN or Password to or otherwise make it available to any other person, whether verbally or by entering it in a way that allows it to be observed by others or otherwise; or (d) enter the PIN in any ATM that does not look genuine, has been modified, has a suspicious device attached or is operating in a suspicious manner. 8.4 If a Transaction is made that requires use of your PIN, you will be deemed to have authorised that Transaction, and you will be liable for any Transaction made with your PIN. 8.5 You agree to indemnify and hold harmless us and our distributors, partners, agents, sponsors and service providers, for and against the costs of any legal action taken to enforce this Agreement and/or any breach of this Agreement or fraudulent use of your Card or PIN by or authorised by you. 9. LOST, STOLEN OR DAMAGED CARDS 9.1 You should treat the e-money on your Card like cash in a wallet. If you lose your Card or it is stolen you may lose any e-money on it in just the same way as if you lost your wallet. 9.2 In the event of loss, theft, fraud or any other risk of an unauthorised use of your Card, or if your Card is damaged or malfunctions, you must immediately call the IVR number and select the appropriate IVR option and follow the instructions or you can contact the Card Support team. You will be asked to provide us with your Card Number and some identifying details. You will be liable for any unauthorised Transactions that take place prior to you notifying us and these will reduce your Available Balance. If there is an Available Balance remaining on your Card, we will replace your Card and transfer the last Available Balance on to it, unless we have any reason to believe that the notified incident has been caused by your breach of this Agreement, gross negligence or if it raises reasonable suspicion of fraudulent or improper conduct. If we replace the Card, the replacement Card will be sent to your address on record. (fees may apply, see paragraph 11). 9.3 You agree to assist us, our partners, affiliates and the police if your Card is lost, stolen or if we suspect that the Card is being misused. 10.

8/28/2017 MyChoice Prepaid Card<br>
<span style="color:red">https:_____________________________________</span><br>
 currency on the day we receive details of that Foreign Currency Transaction. We will use a rate set by the Association. This rate will include a Foreign Exchange Fee (see paragraph 11). Exchange rates can fluctuate and they may change between the time a Transaction is made and the time it is deducted from your Available Balance. 11. FEES AND PRODUCT SUMMARY 11.1 The Cards are subject to certain fees and restrictions set out in the Fees &amp; Limits Schedule annexed to this Agreement or as notified to you from time to time. 11.2 In your Application you were asked to select a base currency in which your Account will be held, and the fees corresponding to your base currency will apply. 11.3 We will deduct any taxes or charges due from the Available Balance on your Card. 11.4 Maintenance fees and dormancy fees, if applicable, will automatically be deducted from your Account each calendar month. 12. DISPUTES<br>
12.1 If you have a reason to believe that any Transaction was unauthorised by you or posted to your Account in error, you may ask us to investigate the Transaction by contacting the Card Support team within 30 days of the date of the relevant Transaction. You must confirm the disputed Transaction in writing, setting out full details of the Transaction, your reasons for disputing it and providing copies of all relevant receipts. If we are satisfied that you have already made all reasonable efforts to resolve the dispute with the relevant Merchant we will attempt to assist you as far as is practicable. 12.2 If the disputed Transaction is investigated and found to be incorrect, the value of the Transaction will be refunded to your Account. Until our investigation is complete the disputed amount will be unavailable to spend. It may later be deducted from your Account if we receive information that proves that the Transaction was genuine. In the event that you do not hold sufficient funds on your Account to make such a repayment you must repay us the disputed amount immediately upon demand. We reserve the right to charge an investigation fee in relation to any dispute, see the Fees &amp; Limits Schedule. 12.3 We reserve the right not to refund sums to you if we believe that you have not acted in accordance with this Agreement. 13.
